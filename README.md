# hello-world
This is my first github repository.
I have my degree in Applied Mathematics from Berkeley. I also minored in physics and took a few computer science courses. Now I work f or an insurance company where I am developing my skills in statistics and working with large datasets. I would like to learn to code and become a data scientist in the future. I am not sure what my path will look like, but I am going to keep pushing forward every day.
